As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working


| Objects       | Messages      |

| Person        | use_bike      |
| Bike          | working_bike?  |


Next, you'll need to create a diagram to demonstrate Object interactions. 
This can take any form you like as long as it shows what your objects will be, and what messages you expect them to respond to

|Person| --use_bike--> |Docking_station| --working_bike?--> (if true) --release_bike--> |Bike|
